# 2018 World Cup Simulator

This application simulates the 2018 football World Cup.

Uses the [football-score-sim](https://github.com/logiclogue/football-score-sim)
package for the simulation.

Each team's name, rating, and group can be customised.

The front-end is build using React JS. This was the first time I had used React
and has been a great learning curve.

I didn't really give the UI much time by using just the default Bootstrap theme.
I really just wanted a simple user interface to interact with the underlying
engine.
